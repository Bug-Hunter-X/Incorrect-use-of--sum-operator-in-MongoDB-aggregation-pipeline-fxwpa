This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: using a string instead of a field name with the `$sum` operator in the `$group` stage.  The `bug.js` file showcases the incorrect implementation, resulting in an error.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct implementation, using the appropriate field name within `$sum`. This example highlights the importance of carefully reviewing field references in MongoDB aggregation queries to prevent unexpected errors.
